### TODO Items

- improved build process and/or a rockspec (top priority)
- implement an "all" ID to turn them all off, set them all to red, etc
- implement an "all" LED # to affect both LEDs on a device
- support setting only 1 of the LEDs; however this isn't supported by the blink library so we 
     need to think about how best to do this (possibly use fade w/a very short time)
- {"serverdown", lfun_serverdown},

### Completed Items
- Methods should give errors when called on closed devices.
